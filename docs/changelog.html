<p>
&nbsp;- Implemented handler that purposefully crashes client whenever any mod attempts to inject unnamed LootPool into any loot table (which is an error state), printing out stacktraces that can be examined to see what mod have done this.

<p/><br/><br/>

<h5><b>[Release 2.10.2]:</b></h5>
<p>
&nbsp;- Fixed Encased Lanterns incorrectly rendering underwater (#121).<br/>

&nbsp;- Added The Acknowledgment entry which provides a bit of lore about ancient tomes [Tattered/Withered/Corrupted], as well as a glimpse into their purpose;<br/>
&nbsp;- Removed Chineese and Russian localization. Old files are still stored in lang directory with "[OUTDATED]" suffix, in case they will be of any use to whoever might decide to help us updating those localizations, but so far they were not touched for a long time and the amount of changes brough to the mod in the meantime rendered them horribly broken;<br/>
&nbsp;- Fixed completely black "Heat" title above heat bar rendered by Blazing Core. Okay I'm not even gonna ask anymore why nobody reports this stuff;<br/>
&nbsp;- Permanent item entites, which include Extradimensional Vessels and Soul Crystals, can no longer be moved between dimensions.

&nbsp;- Among particularly noticeable improvements, most options in common file are now automatically synchronized from server to client;<br/>

&nbsp;- Neutral mobs no longer anger against players who bear Ring of the Seven Curses, unless there is a direct line of sight between them and the player, aka don't see players through walls anymore. Well, most of the time. They can still see the cursed players regardless of obstacles if the distance separating the player from them is below 4 blocks (#81);<br/>
&nbsp;- Endermen generally follow the abovementioned rule, but sometimes they might randomly disregard it and teleport behind unsuspecting player seemingly out of nowhere (#81);<br/>
&nbsp;- +1 Joke in Twisted Mirror entry in The Acknowledgment (#81);<br/>
&nbsp;- Significantly expanded The Acknowledgment entry on Ring of the Seven Curses, to provided explanation on how every curse works. Many players have found some of them unclear, like insomnia for instance, so that should be now addressed. Blessings did not receive as much attention, but it's now mentioned that they come along with the ring as permanent traits, similar to how curses do.<br/>
<p/><br/><br/>


<h5><b>[Release 2.5.3]:</b></h5>
<p>

<p/><br/><br/>


<h5><b>[Release 2.5.2]:</b></h5>
<p>

&nbsp;- Fixed active abilities of spellstones not having any cooldown at all (okay, but THIS?..);<br/>
&nbsp;- Fixed The Architect's Inkwell crashing the server when attempting to open it's GUI (#76).<br/>
<p/><br/><br/>


<h5><b>[Release 2.5.1]:</b></h5>
<p>
&nbsp;- Fixed crash on server startup (#75).<br/>
<p/><br/><br/>

&nbsp;- Will of the Ocean's damage reduction against underwater creatures no longer includes drowned, to ensure consistency with vanilla logic;<br/>
&nbsp;- Blazing Core now provides only temporary immunity to lava;<br/>
&nbsp;- Pearl of the Void now provides complete immunity to any status effects. Removed it's trait that prevents hunger from affecting the bearer. Chance of death prevention is buffed from 15% to 35%;<br/>

&nbsp;- Implemented config options that allow to adjust dealt and received damage multipliers that bearers of the Ring of the Seven Curses are affected by;<br/>
&nbsp;- Disabled attribute tooltip on Will of the Ocean due to being redundant;<br/>
&nbsp;- Enigmatic Legacy now automatically triggers "minecraft:recipe_unlocked" trigger for every recipe player has unlocked when they join the world. Required due to some recipes in the mod requiring certain parent recipes to be unlocked, and new recipes added may never have this condition fulfilled. Also should be a good practice overall;<br/>
&nbsp;- Raised the Config Version to 1.2.<br/>
<p/><br/><br/>


<h5><b>[Release 2.4.0]:</b></h5>
<p>
&nbsp;- Initial 1.16.3 port. Should be backwards compatible with 1.16.2 but don't blame me if stuff breaks if you run it there.<br/>

<p/><br/><br/>


<h5><b>[Release 2.2.1]:</b></h5>

<p/><br/><br/>


<h5><b>[Release 2.2.0]:</b></h5>
<p>
&nbsp;- Angel's Blessing now actually redirects projectiles through ProjectileImpactEvent handler instead of cloning them in LivingAttackEvent;<br/>
&nbsp;- Due to the previous, a bug is fixed where redirected tridents for some reason were unable to deal damage;<br/>

<p/><br/><br/>


<h5><b>[Release 2.1.2]:</b></h5>
<p>
&nbsp;- Fixed startup error caused by attempts to reset null config object when generating config file (#52).<br/>
<p/><br/><br/>


<h5><b>[Release 2.1.1]:</b></h5>
<p>
&nbsp;- Fixed critical error on startup caused by screwed up mods.toml file.<br/>
<p/><br/><br/>


<h5><b>[Release 2.1.0]:</b></h5>

&nbsp;- Optional Soul Loss mechanic can now be enabled through config.<br/><br/>
* I know it's "Dependecy-Free" and all, but I already ended up using multiple hooks outside of generic API, and that number will likely only increase as I attempt to tweak more custom functionality into our Enigmatinomicon. Besides, I never wanted it to be optional addition in the first place.<br/>
<p/><br/><br/>

<p/><br/><br/>
