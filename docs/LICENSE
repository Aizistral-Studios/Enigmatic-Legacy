Issue Date: 02.11.2020
Issuer: Aizistral

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim or modified
copies of this license document, and changing it is allowed as long
as the name is changed.



I. Terminology

1. Any intellectual property that is distributed under the terms of this license - further referenced as "works".

2. The copyright holder and owner of such works - further reffered to as the "Creator".



II. Extension

1. This license does extend over any code, assets and binaries that are part of Creator's works, including but not limited to contents of repositories that may contain such code, assets or binaries in publicly available form, unless otherwise indicated.

2. The Creator reserves all rights in regards to their works that are not explicitly covered and defined otherwise by this license.



III. Warranties

1. Works of the Creator are provided "as is", in hope they will be useful, but without ANY warranties. The Creator takes no responsibility for any damage that may be suffered from any attempts, consequences of attempts or anything connected to attempts to use their works, in the intended ways or not, regardless of the intent, purpose or circumstances of such attempts.



IV. Terms for Featuring, Redistribution, Copying and Modification

1. "Featuring" refers to using the Creator's works in an environment where you do not redistribute binaries, assets, or source code (an example would be a YouTube Let's Play). You are permitted to feature the Creator's works in an instance if all of the following criteria are met:

- You must not claim ownership for any part of the Creator's works.

The one abovementioned criteria is mandatory, unless otherwise is explicitly indicated.


2. You are permitted to redistribute unmodifed works obtained from official, publicly available sources provided by the Creator, in an instance if all of the following criteria are met:

- The integrity of the Creator's works stays preserved. In case of binaries - they must stay completely unmodified. In case of code and assets - they must be obtained from official repositories and come in their entirety, with no files being altered or removed. If this criteria is not met, your use case falls under the terms for copying, modification and incorporation outlined below;
- You explicitly and clearly inform users that you do not own the Creator's works, and reference Creator themselves as the owner;
- You provide at least one direct link to the official distribution source provided by the Creator themselves;
- You have praised the Sun at least once in your lifetime;
- Your redistribution bears non-commercial purpose; you do not charge for downloading or otherwise obtaining Creator's works, and do not monetize the process in any way, shape or form, including, but not limited to: monetizable links, such as URL shorteners, or advertisements in your service that somehow interfere with downloading process, or any form of paywal.

Not meeting this criteria will not neccesarily lead to any action taken by the Creator and does not explicitly violate terms of this license, but the Creator reserves the right to permanently revoke copying, redistribution and modification permissions from any person or party that does not fulfill them. Meeting all five of the abovementioned criteria ensures these rights cannot be revoked from you, as long as the criteria are met.


3. You are permitted to copy, modify and incorporate any parts of the Creator's works into your projects, in an instance if all of the following criteria are met:

- You explicitly and clearly inform users that you do not own the Creator's works, and reference Creator themselves as the owner;
- If you do any modifications to parts of Creator's works that you copy or incorporate, you should provide clear and explicit indication that this is done;
- Any parts of your project that copy, modify, incorporate, depend on or extend any parts of the Creator's works must be open-source (have its source visible and allow for redistribution and modification), and include a criteria similar to this one in license that applies to them.

The three abovementioned criteria are mandatory, unless otherwise is explicitly indicated.



V. General Clauses and Exceptions

1. Waive Clause:
All restrictions applied within Terms for Featuring, Redistribution, Copying and Modification of this license do not apply to you if you have personal permission of the Creator. The Creator reserves the right to provide personal permission to any person or party, or revoke it from any person or party it was previosly granted to. Be informed, however, that the Creator is under no obligation to provide the permission to anyone, regardless of the reasons and circumstances of it being requested.


2. Postmortal Clause:
Confirmed physical death of the Creator permanently invalidates any of the restrictions applied within Terms for Featuring, Redistribution, Copying and Modification of this license. They are also invalidated in case one century (100 years) have passed since this license was issued, regardless of the Creator's physical state.


3. API Clause:
All restrictions applied within Terms for Featuring, Redistribution, Copying and Modification of this license do not apply to API packages within the source code of the Creator's works. API package is any Java package (and all contents of such package) that is specifically named 'api' and that does contain 'package-info.java' file, which in order explicitly indicates such package as API. However, if you redistribute and incorporate API packages of the Creator's works, they must be incliuded verbatim as they were obtained; otherwise this clause does not apply and you use falls under paragraph 3 of Terms for Featuring, Redistribution, Copying and Modification of this license.
